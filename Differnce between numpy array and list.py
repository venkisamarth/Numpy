#A list cannot directly handle mathematical operations,while array can 
#An array consumes less memory than a list  
# using am array is faster than a list 
# a list can store diffrent  datatypes  while you can't do that in an Array
# A list is easier  to modify  since a list store  each ellements  indviduvaly ,it  is easier to add  
#and delete an elements than an array does
